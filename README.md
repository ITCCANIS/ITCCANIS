Hi there, I'm Aissani Anis ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a software engineering student with a background in mathematics. Here's a bit about me:

ðŸŽ“ I studied mathematics for 3 years at university and earned a bachelor's degree in the field. While math isn't my strongest suit, it led me to discover my passion for Data Science software engineering.
ðŸ’» I'm now focused on full-stack web development and database administration, having learned the essentials of both. I also have a keen interest in AI and data science, which I began exploring during my math studies.
